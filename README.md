# Vim config

This is config that works for me, if you find things you like, help yourself. If you find things you know could be better, please send me a message and explain.
This is extremely well start configuration if you use ruby, rspec, cucumber, javascript, coffeescript and backbone.
Also Haml and Sass.

## Warning: Submodules

If you pull, this is what you should do

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

    $ ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    $ ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
